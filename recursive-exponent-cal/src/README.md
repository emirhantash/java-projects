## **Calculating Exponents with Recursive Methods**

*We write a program that uses the "Recursive" method for exponentiation, whose base and exponent values are taken from the user in Java*

```
Enter the base value: 2
Enter the exponent: 0
Result: 1
Enter the base value: 2
Enter the exponent: 3
Result: 8
Enter the base value: 5
Enter the exponent: 3
Result: 125
